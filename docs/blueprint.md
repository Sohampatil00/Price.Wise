# **App Name**: Equitable Edge

## Core Features:

- Smart Business Onboarding & Data Intelligence: Collect business details, financial inputs, and historical data upon account creation, and then automatically analyze demand elasticity, identify optimal price ranges, tag essential goods, and build a pricing baseline.
- Emergency Mode Auto-Activation AI: Continuously monitor global crisis alerts, regional disasters, health outbreaks, and supply chain interruptions, and when triggered, freeze essential goods pricing, apply price ceilings, prevent artificial inflation, notify users, and log all changes for audit.  The reasoning for freezing the price will be provided as a tool for the LLM.
- Equity-Based Pricing Algorithm: Dynamically calculate fair prices based on regional income levels, cost of living, demand pressure, and supply availability, with reduced essential goods pricing in low-income regions and small premiums allowed in high-income regions, and a system for self-balancing profits across regions.  The algorithm selection will be provided as a tool for the LLM.
- Essential Goods Protection Engine: Automatically classify and prioritize medicines, baby products, food staples, hygiene supplies, and emergency tools, and during a crisis, lock them under controlled pricing, prioritize inventory flow, and block bulk hoarding behavior.
- Competitor Fairness Radar: Build real-time dashboards to track competitor prices, detect emergency price abuse, compare with ethical pricing benchmarks, and highlight exploitation zones, including heatmaps, price divergence alerts, and transparency reports.
- Predictive Shortage Prevention AI: Use forecasting to predict demand surges, identify stock risk days in advance, smooth panic buying patterns, and recommend inventory shifts, and then automatically adjust pricing curves, reorder alerts, and stock distribution.
- Seller & Regulator Dashboards: Provide sellers with real-time pricing, demand forecast, profit vs. fairness graphs, emergency status, and inventory health, and regulators/admins with price lock controls, exploitation detection, compliance scores, and crisis history logs.
